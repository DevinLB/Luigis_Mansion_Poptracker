# Luigi's Mansion PopTracker 0.1.1

This is the PopTracker pack for Luigi's Mansion Archipelago randomizer.
This was made for version 0.5.21 of the Luigi's Mansion apworld. While it should be fine, using this tracker on newer/older versions may cause some functions and logic to misbehave.

## Installation

Download the lmpt.zip file and install the pack to your PopTracker. On the PopTracker itself, navigate to the folder in the top left and select the version of this tracker that you installed.

## To-Do

1. Verify full functionality of code and logic accessiblity.
2. Add Room Map version. 
3. Reorder the small keys for more intuitive placement.
4. Separate checks on the balcony and roof for easier visibility.

## Known Issues

1. Map might skew off the screen on certain resolution/scale sizes.
2. Starting Room Boo Location will read as accessible when it may not be (Luigi must be able to leave and reenter the room with a door in order to spawn that boo)
